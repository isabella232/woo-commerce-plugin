Easily subscribe customers to your Campaign Monitor mailing list at checkout.

== Description ==
Campaign Monitor for WooCommerce allows your customers to sign up to a list in your [campaignmonitor.com](https://www.campaignmonitor.com?utm_source=woocommerce-plugin&utm_medium=referral) account at checkout. You can then use your list to send campaigns or automated journeys.

Get started with pre-packaged segments. Once connected with your Campaign Monitor account, you’ll automatically be set up with segments, which help you target smaller groups of subscribers:

* High Spending Customers — Keep your biggest spenders engaged and spending with you, perhaps by offering them an exclusive promotion.
* Repeat Customers — Recognize and reward your loyal customers with a unique email offer.
* First-time Customers — Welcome each new customer in a personalized way, and perhaps offer them a discount on their second purchase.
* Newsletter Subscribers — Immediately add all newsletter subscribers to a list in your campaignmonitor.com account.

= Updating from 1.3.2 and earlier =
PHP 7 introduced connectivity issues between our plugin and Campaign Monitor when the WordPress site is not running on HTTPS. We are unable to resolve this problem with a regular update from your Admin. If you are experiencing this problem, you will need to disconnect, delete the plugin and install the latest version. We apologize for the inconvenience.
